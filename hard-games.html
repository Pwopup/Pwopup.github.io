	<h2 id="dark_souls">Dark Souls 3</h2>
	<p>There's no way anyone would dare create a list of this nature without mentioning a Dark Souls game. The series is known for its punishing level of difficulty, involved combat system, and the necessity to plot out your strategy by learning from what will be many, many deaths.

	Fans of the series can't seem to agree on which game in the franchise is the most difficult. Some say Dark Souls 2 is the easiest while some say Dark Souls 3 is easier than the second. Many fans say that Dark Souls and Dark Souls 3 have harder boss battles, while Dark Souls 2 has harder areas to traverse and clear.

	Either way, the next to impossible level of difficulty in any of the Souls games makes accomplishing even the smallest of tasks a very rewarding 
	experience.</p>

	<h2 id="cuphead">Cuphead</h2>
	<p>
	On the fictional Inkwell Isles, Cuphead and his brother Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live under the watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers enter the Devil's Casino and begin playing craps. When they go on a winning streak, the Devil himself offers to raise the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win one more roll, they will receive all the money in the casino; if not, the Devil will take their souls. Cuphead loses by rolling snake eyes, and he and Mugman beg for mercy. The Devil makes a deal with them: collect the "soul contracts" that signify his ownership of the souls of his runaway debtors by midnight the next day, and he might let them keep theirs. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest, but also warns them the debtors may change themselves to different things in attempt to stop them.

	The brothers travel around the Inkwell Isles, fighting the residents who have lost their souls to the Devil in order to obtain their contracts. On entering the second island, the Elder Kettle informs them about "doing the right thing" when they come up against the Devil again. Once they have the contracts, they return to the Devil's Casino, but its manager King Dice blocks their way. He has lost a bet with the Devil, presumably over whether Cuphead and Mugman would be able to complete their task, and forces them to fight his own henchmen before confronting them directly. After the brothers defeat King Dice, the Devil demands that they hand over the contracts in exchange for "joining his team". What happens next depends on the choice of the player. If the player decides to do so, the Devil turns Cuphead and Mugman into his demonic lackeys and the game ends. If the player declines, the Devil becomes furious at the brothers' refusal to honor their deal and fights them himself. Cuphead and Mugman triumph over him, burn the contracts, and race home. Learning that they no longer have anything to fear from the Devil, the former debtors honor the brothers for their heroic actions.</p>

	<h2 id="dont_starve">Don't Starve</h2>
	<p>The thing about the Don't Starve survival series is you're going to starve. You're going to starve a lot. You're going to get killed by monsters in the night. A lot. You will lose your sanity. A lot. The early experiences in this game are so difficult it would easily turn off a more casual game player. Even long-time players have complained that updates have made the game too hard to be fun.

	Like most survival games, perseverance, learning about the world and its mechanics, hoarding resources, and learning "recipes," will eventually put you in a situation that makes the game feel less gruesome.</p>

	<h2 id="super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</h2>
	<p>Super Meat Boy could very well be one of the hardest games on this list, but it also might be the most fun. While the death animation is extremely simple, there is something about watching that little cube of meat explode that never seems to get old. Dying and losing in this game is extremely entertaining and oddly satisfying. You don't find yourself getting so frustrated with each failure that you get to the point of wanting to destroy your gaming equipment - you find yourself laughing.</p>

	<h2 id="i_am_bread">I Am Bread</h2>
	<p>I Am Bread is an excellent game about a piece of bread that wants nothing more out of life than to be toasted. When the homeowner is away, it's on like Donkey Kong!

	The four main buttons on your console serve as each corner of the titular piece of bread. You teeter-totter between buttons trying to get the bread to keep flipping over. The game physics make doing something as basic as moving an extremely difficult task, but the physics are fair and seem grounded in reality.

	If getting a hang of the twisted controls just to move in a straight line wasn't hard enough, you also have to roll all over the various rooms of the house, attempt to climb cupboards, tables, and dressers, and avoid rolling over items that will stick to you. To add to the difficulty, nothing is there to let you know how to toast yourself. You might have to look for an old light-bulb or other device that's been left on. It's not as easy as finding the toaster.</p>

	<h2 id="get_over_it">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</h2>
	<p>Getting Over It revolves around a silent man by the name of Diogenes stuck in a cauldron and wielding a Yosemite hammer, which he can use to grip objects and move himself. Using the mouse or trackpad (controllers are supported but make the game harder because of the lack of precision in the joysticks), the player tries to move the man's upper body and sledge hammer in order to climb a steep mountain.[4]

	The game is accompanied by voice-over commentary by Bennett Foddy discussing various philosophical topics. The commentary also provides quotations relating to disappointment and perseverance when significant progress is lost by the player.[7]

	The game increases in difficulty as the player progress up the mountain. There are no checkpoints; the player is at a constant risk of losing some or all of their progress.[8] The game concludes when a player reaches the highest point of the map and then enters space. Upon reaching the conclusion, a message asks players if they are recording the game play. When a player indicates they are not, the game provides access to a chatroom populated by other players who have completed the game.</p>
